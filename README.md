# Heller

Heller is a thin Ruby wrapper around the official jars from Kafka, much like
[Mikka](https://github.com/iconara/mikka) is a Ruby wrapper around Akka.

The goal of Heller is to make the Producer and Consumer APIs of Kafka more
Rubyesque (major pun intended). Thus it is to be considered a client library.

## Status

The project is currently under development, and I wouldn't really recommend it
to be used in any form of production environment. There is still quite some work
that needs to be done for both the Producer and Consumer APIs.

It's getting there, though I'm mostly doing this during my spare time, which is
sparse at times.
